# Advanced-regression-using-neural-networks

• Part 1: Create a neural network mini-library. You will create a low-level implementation of a multi-layered neural network, including a basic implementation of the
backpropagation algorithm. The task also involves implementing necessary functions for
data preprocessing, training and evaluation.

• Part 2: Create and train a neural network for regression. You will develop and
optimise a neural network architecture to predict the price of houses in California using
the California House Prices Dataset. For this task, you will have the choice to either use
PyTorch or the mini-library you have just developed.
